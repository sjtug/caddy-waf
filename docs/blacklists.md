# Blacklists

The middleware loads IP and DNS blacklists plus an optional IP whitelist at startup and on demand. All are plain-text files. Blacklist loaders live in [`blacklist.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/blacklist.go); the whitelist loader lives in [`ipwhitelist.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/ipwhitelist.go).

## Common file syntax

- One entry per line.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Empty lines are skipped.
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and skipped.
- Files are read with UTF-8 expectations (no BOM handling).

## IP blacklist (`ip_blacklist_file`)

- **Configuration directive**: `ip_blacklist_file <path>`
- **Storage**: a [`go-iptrie`](https://github.com/phemmer/go-iptrie) prefix trie. Single addresses are stored as `/32` (IPv4) or `/128` (IPv6) prefixes; CIDR ranges are stored as-is.
- **Lookup path**: at request time the source IP is parsed with `netip.ParseAddr` and a `Contains` check against the trie is performed. If the file is missing, the lookup is a no-op (no requests are blocked by the IP layer).
- **Source IP selection**: `r.RemoteAddr` (host portion) is **always** checked, since it is the only value a client cannot forge. Every hop in `X-Forwarded-For` is checked **in addition**, so a deployment behind a proxy still matches on the forwarded client IP. Consulting the header *instead of* the peer address, as releases before v0.3.8 did, let any blacklisted client bypass the list with one header (GHSA-gfj3-cmff-q8wh's sibling advisory, GHSA-w6gv-76q4-prqg).
- **Host normalisation**: the DNS blacklist lowercases the `Host` header and strips the port and any trailing dot before matching, so `evil.example`, `EVIL.EXAMPLE:8080` and `evil.example.` all match the same entry.
- **Validation**: each entry is parsed first as a CIDR range (`net.ParseCIDR`) and, on failure, as a single IP (`net.ParseIP`). Invalid lines are logged at WARN level and counted as `invalid_entries`; valid lines are counted as `valid_entries`.

### Accepted entry forms

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| IPv4 single address | `192.0.2.10` |
| IPv4 CIDR | `192.0.2.0/24` |
| IPv6 single address (full or shortened) | `2001:db8::1`, `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` |
| IPv6 CIDR | `2001:db8::/32` |
| Comment | `# scanner subnet` |

### Sample file

```text
# Block specific scanners
192.0.2.10
198.51.100.42

# Block ranges
203.0.113.0/24
2001:db8::/32

# Block private ranges (only meaningful behind a trusted proxy)
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12
192.168.0.0/16
```

### Hot reload

When the IP blacklist file is written in place or atomically replaced, the file watcher (`fsnotify`) triggers `ReloadConfig`, which builds a new trie and atomically swaps it in. In-flight requests continue to see the previous trie; subsequent requests see the new one.

The Tor exit-node fetcher writes its own file (`tor_ip_blacklist_file`); to have those addresses become effective in the IP blacklist they must be appended to the file referenced by `ip_blacklist_file` (or that file must be the Tor file).

## IP whitelist (`ip_whitelist_file`)

- **Configuration directive**: `ip_whitelist_file <path>`
- **Accepted entries**: bare IPv4/IPv6 addresses, CIDR ranges, and the token `private_ranges`, using the [common file syntax](#common-file-syntax).
- **Combination**: file entries are unioned with every inline `whitelist_ip` entry.
- **Validation**: unlike blacklist files, one invalid whitelist entry rejects the entire load. At startup this fails provisioning; during hot reload the active last known-good trie is retained.
- **Semantics**: matches the direct peer address only and exempts it from IP blacklist, GeoIP country, and ASN checks. It does not exempt DNS blacklist, rate-limit, or regex-rule checks. See [IP whitelist](configuration.md#ip-whitelist) for the security rationale and reverse-proxy warning.

### Sample file

```text
# Exempt a published service range
203.0.113.0/24
2001:db8:1234::/48

# Also accepted, with the same edge-only warning as the inline directive
private_ranges
```

### Hot reload

Writes and atomic replacements call `ReloadIPWhitelist`. The replacement trie is built and validated before it is swapped into service. A malformed or unreadable update is logged and leaves the previous whitelist active.

## DNS blacklist (`dns_blacklist_file`)

- **Configuration directive**: `dns_blacklist_file <path>`
- **Storage**: a `map[string]struct{}` for O(1) lookup.
- **Normalisation**: every entry is `strings.ToLower(strings.TrimSpace(line))` at load time. The runtime check normalises `r.Host` the same way.
- **Match semantics**: **exact** match. Subdomains are not implicitly blocked. To block `evil.example.com` and all of its subdomains, list each one individually.
- **Internationalised domains**: store as Punycode (e.g. `xn--80ak6aa92e.com`).
- **Lookup path**: the `Host` header on the request is normalised and looked up; on hit, the request is blocked with `403` and `dns_blacklist_hits` is incremented.

### Sample file

```text
# Phishing
phish.example
malware.example.org

# Punycode form for IDN
xn--80ak6aa92e.com

# Comments are skipped
```

### Hot reload

Identical to the IP blacklist: an in-place write or atomic replacement triggers `ReloadConfig`, which rebuilds the map and swaps it in atomically.

## Counters

| Metric | Source |
|---|---|
| `ip_blacklist_hits` | Incremented every time the IP trie returns a match (see `isIPBlacklisted` in [`blacklist.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/blacklist.go)). |
| `dns_blacklist_hits` | Incremented every time the DNS map returns a match (see `isDNSBlacklisted`). |

Both are reported by the `/waf_metrics` endpoint — see [metrics.md](metrics.md).

## Rule of precedence

In Phase 1 the order is fixed: the IP whitelist is checked first, then the IP blacklist, DNS blacklist, rate limiter, and GeoIP / ASN controls. A whitelist match skips only the IP blacklist and GeoIP / ASN controls; a blacklist match short-circuits the rest of the request, so the regex rule engine is not invoked.

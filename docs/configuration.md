# Configuration

This document describes the request lifecycle, every Caddyfile directive recognised by the `waf` block, every JSON-only field on the middleware, and the order in which blocking decisions are taken.

The directive parser is implemented in [`config.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/config.go); the runtime fields are declared on the `Middleware` struct in [`types.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/types.go); the request pipeline lives in [`handler.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/handler.go).

---

## Request lifecycle

For each incoming request, [`Middleware.ServeHTTP`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/handler.go) performs the following steps:

1. **Generate a `log_id`** (UUID v4) and propagate it via `context.Context` so all log records for the request can be correlated.
2. **Install a panic recovery** that returns `500 Internal Server Error` on panic and logs the stack trace.
3. **Increment `total_requests`** in the metrics counters.
4. **Initialise `WAFState`** with `TotalScore=0`, `Blocked=false`, `StatusCode=200`, `ResponseWritten=false`.
5. **Phase 1** — pre-request checks, then Phase 1 regex rules. Returns immediately if blocked.
6. **Phase 2** — Phase 2 regex rules. Returns immediately if blocked.
7. **Call the next handler**, capturing its response into a `responseRecorder` (the recorder buffers the body, but delegates `Header()` and `WriteHeader()` directly to the underlying `ResponseWriter`).
8. **Phase 3** — Phase 3 regex rules against captured response headers. Returns immediately if blocked.
9. **Phase 4** — Phase 4 regex rules against the captured response body.
10. If the request matches the configured `metrics_endpoint`, serve the JSON metrics document (see [metrics.md](metrics.md)).
11. Otherwise, copy the recorded response body to the original `ResponseWriter` and increment `allowed_requests`.

### Phase 1 — pre-request checks (in order)

The order below reflects the actual code in [`handler.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/handler.go) (`handlePhase`, `phase==1`):

0. **IP whitelist** — when `whitelist_ip` is configured and the **peer address** matches, steps 1, 4, 5 and 6 below are skipped. See [IP whitelist](#ip-whitelist).
1. **IP blacklist** — always checks `r.RemoteAddr`, plus every `X-Forwarded-For` hop in addition. Match → `403`.
2. **DNS blacklist** — exact (case-insensitive) match against `r.Host`. Match → `403`.
3. **Rate limit** — when configured. Exceeded → `429 Too Many Requests`.
4. **Country whitelist** — when enabled, request is blocked unless the source country is in the list. On lookup failure: `geoip_fail_open` controls behaviour.
5. **ASN block** — when enabled. Match → `403`.
6. **Country blacklist** — when enabled. Match → `403`.
7. **Phase 1 regex rules**.

### Phase 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 regex rule evaluation

Within each phase the runtime iterates over the rules already sorted by descending `priority` (see [rules.md](rules.md)). For each rule:

1. The rule's `targets` are extracted in turn (URI, headers, body, JSON path, …).
2. Each extracted value is matched against the compiled regex.
3. On match:
   - The rule's per-ID hit counter (`atomic.Int64`) is incremented.
   - The per-phase hit counter is incremented.
   - The rule's `score` is added to `state.TotalScore`.
   - The request is **blocked** if either of the following is true:
     - `state.TotalScore >= anomaly_threshold`
     - the rule's `mode` field equals `"block"`
   - When blocked, `403 Forbidden` is written (or the configured custom response for that status code), and rule processing stops for that phase.
   - When the rule's `mode` is `"log"` and neither condition above is true, processing continues with the next target/rule.

### Blocking precedence summary

```
IP whitelist          (Phase 1, first)          — exempts the four IP-reputation checks below
IP blacklist          (Phase 1, before rules)
DNS blacklist         (Phase 1, before rules)
Rate limit            (Phase 1, before rules)
Country whitelist     (Phase 1, before rules)   — geoip_fail_open governs lookup errors
ASN block             (Phase 1, before rules)
Country blacklist     (Phase 1, before rules)
Phase 1 rules         (priority-ordered)
Phase 2 rules         (priority-ordered)
Phase 3 rules         (response headers, after upstream)
Phase 4 rules         (response body, after upstream)
```

A `block` action from any rule, or any pre-request check above, short-circuits the rest of the pipeline.

### Custom block responses

If `custom_response` is configured for the resulting status code, the registered Content-Type, headers, and body replace the default `Request blocked by WAF. Reason: <reason>` plain-text response.

## Caddyfile directives

The full list is the `directiveHandlers` map in [`config.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/config.go). All directives below appear inside a `waf { ... }` block.

| Directive | Arguments | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metrics_endpoint` | `<path>` | unset | URL path for the JSON metrics document (must start with `/`). When unset, no metrics endpoint is exposed. |
| `log_path` | `<file>` | `debug.json` (Caddyfile) / `log.json` (Provision fallback) | File path for the JSON log sink. The middleware always writes to stdout in addition. |
| `log_severity` | `debug` \| `info` \| `warn` \| `error` | `info` | Minimum log level for the WAF logger. |
| `log_json` | _(no args)_ | off | Enable JSON-formatted logs. Sets the `LogJSON` boolean to `true`. |
| `log_buffer` | `<positive int>` | `1000` | Capacity of the asynchronous log channel. When full, logs fall back to synchronous emission. |
| `rule_file` | `<file>` | none | Path to a JSON rule file. Repeat the directive to load multiple files. At least one `rule_file` is required. |
| `ip_blacklist_file` | `<file>` | unset | Path to the IP blacklist (single IPs and CIDR ranges). The file is created empty if it does not exist. |
| `ip_whitelist_file` | `<file>` | unset | Path to a hot-reloadable IP whitelist. Accepts the same entries as `whitelist_ip`, one per line; blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. The file is created empty if it does not exist. |
| `dns_blacklist_file` | `<file>` | unset | Path to the DNS blacklist (one host per line). The file is created empty if it does not exist. |
| `whitelist_ip` | `<entry> [<entry> …]` | unset | Inline IPs, CIDR ranges, or the token `private_ranges`, exempt from the **IP-reputation** checks. Repeatable and combined with `ip_whitelist_file`. See [IP whitelist](#ip-whitelist). |
| `anomaly_threshold` | `<positive int>` | `5` (Caddyfile) / `20` (Provision fallback) | Score at which a request is blocked. Lower values are stricter. |
| `max_request_body_size` | `<bytes>` | `10485760` (10 MiB) | Upper bound for request body reads via `io.LimitReader`. `0` means "use the default". |
| `max_response_body_size` | `<bytes>` | `10485760` (10 MiB) | Upper bound on how much of the response body is held in memory for Phase 4 inspection. `0` means "use the default". See [Response body buffering](#response-body-buffering). |
| `block_countries` | `<mmdb> <ISO> [<ISO> …]` | disabled | Block requests whose source country (per the GeoLite2 Country MMDB) is in the list. |
| `whitelist_countries` | `<mmdb> <ISO> [<ISO> …]` | disabled | Allow only requests whose source country is in the list. |
| `block_asns` | `<mmdb> <ASN> [<ASN> …]` | disabled | Block requests whose source IP belongs to one of the listed ASNs. ASN values are decimal integers without a leading `AS`. |
| `custom_response` | `<status> <content-type> <inline-body…>` _or_ `<status> <content-type> <file-path>` | unset | Custom block response. Repeat with different status codes. |
| `redact_sensitive_data` | _(no args)_ | off | Redact sensitive query parameters and log fields. The redaction key list is in [`logging.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/logging.go) (`sensitiveKeys`). |
| `tor` | block (see below) | disabled | Enable Tor exit-node blocking. |
| `rate_limit` | block (see below) | disabled | Enable per-IP rate limiting. |

### `rate_limit` block

Parsed in [`config.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/config.go) (`parseRateLimit`).

| Sub-directive | Arguments | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requests` | `<positive int>` | `100` | Maximum requests permitted per `window` per IP (or per `ip+path` when `paths` is set and `match_all_paths=false`). |
| `window` | `<duration>` | `10s` | Sliding-window duration. Accepts Go duration syntax (`10s`, `1m`, `1h`). |
| `cleanup_interval` | `<duration>` | `300s` | How often expired entries are swept from the in-memory map. |
| `paths` | `<regex…>` | empty | One or more Go regex patterns. When non-empty and `match_all_paths=false`, only matching paths are rate-limited; non-matching paths bypass the limiter. |
| `match_all_paths` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | When `true`, rate-limit every request regardless of `paths` (key is the IP only). When `false` and `paths` is empty, the limiter is effectively a no-op. |

Behavioural details (see [ratelimit.md](ratelimit.md) for the full discussion):

- The bucket key is `ip` when `match_all_paths=true`, and `ip+path` when matching by `paths`.
- A request is blocked with `429 Too Many Requests` once the bucket exceeds `requests` within `window`.
- Rate-limit metrics are exposed as `rate_limiter_requests` and `rate_limiter_blocked_requests` in `/waf_metrics`.

### `tor` block

Parsed in [`config.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/config.go) (`parseTorBlock`); fetcher in [`tor.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/tor.go).

| Sub-directive | Arguments | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | Toggle Tor exit-node fetching. |
| `tor_ip_blacklist_file` | `<file>` | `tor_blacklist.txt` | File where fetched exit-node IPs are persisted. The contents are merged into the IP blacklist file used by `ip_blacklist_file` when configured to point at the same file. |
| `update_interval` | `<duration>` | `24h` | Interval between successful fetches from `https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist`. |
| `retry_on_failure` | `true` \| `false` | `false` | When the fetch fails, retry after `retry_interval` instead of waiting for the next `update_interval` tick. |
| `retry_interval` | `<duration>` | `5m` | Delay between retries when `retry_on_failure=true`. |

The HTTP client used for the fetch has a 30 s timeout. A custom URL can be supplied via JSON only — see [the JSON-only fields](#json-only-fields) below.

### `custom_response` directive

Two forms are accepted:

```caddyfile
custom_response 403 application/json error.json     # body loaded from file
custom_response 429 text/plain Too many requests.   # inline body (joined with spaces)
```

- The status code must satisfy `100 <= code <= 599`.
- A second `custom_response` for the same status code is rejected.
- The Content-Type is the second token; everything that follows is either the file path or the inline body.

### Defaults set by the parser

When the `waf` block is parsed, [`UnmarshalCaddyfile`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/config.go) sets the following defaults before processing directives:

| Field | Default |
|---|---|
| `LogSeverity` | `info` |
| `LogJSON` | `false` |
| `AnomalyThreshold` | `5` |
| `CountryBlacklist.Enabled` | `false` |
| `CountryWhitelist.Enabled` | `false` |
| `BlockASNs.Enabled` | `false` |
| `LogFilePath` | `debug.json` |
| `RedactSensitiveData` | `false` |
| `LogBuffer` | `1000` |
| `Tor.Enabled` | `false` |
| `Tor.TORIPBlacklistFile` | `tor_blacklist.txt` |
| `Tor.UpdateInterval` | `24h` |
| `Tor.RetryOnFailure` | `false` |
| `Tor.RetryInterval` | `5m` |

Additional defaults applied during `Provision` (after Caddyfile parsing):

- If `LogSeverity` is empty → `info`.
- If `LogFilePath` is empty → `log.json` (Provision fallback differs from the parser default).
- If `AnomalyThreshold <= 0` → `20`.

---

## JSON-only fields

The following fields exist on the `Middleware` struct (in [`types.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/types.go)) and are honoured by the runtime, but are **not** wired up to the Caddyfile parser. To set them, configure Caddy via JSON instead of a Caddyfile.

| Field | JSON key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GeoIPFailOpen` | `geoip_fail_open` | bool | `false` | When `true`, a GeoIP/ASN lookup error allows the request through; otherwise the request is blocked with `403`. |
| `CustomResponses` | `custom_responses` | map[int]CustomBlockResponse | unset | Same as the `custom_response` directive but as a JSON map of status codes. |
| `Tor.CustomTORExitNodeURL` | `tor.custom_tor_exit_node_url` | string | `https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist` | Override URL for the exit-node feed. |

Additionally:

- `geoIPCacheTTL` and `geoIPLookupFallbackBehavior` are configured on the `GeoIPHandler` programmatically (see [`caddywaf.go`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/caddywaf.go), `Provision`); they do not currently have Caddyfile or JSON tags.

A JSON config snippet equivalent to the minimal Caddyfile:

```json
{
  "handler": "waf",
  "rule_files": ["rules.json"],
  "ip_blacklist_file": "ip_blacklist.txt",
  "ip_whitelist_file": "ip_whitelist.txt",
  "dns_blacklist_file": "dns_blacklist.txt",
  "metrics_endpoint": "/waf_metrics",
  "anomaly_threshold": 20,
  "max_request_body_size": 20971520,
  "max_response_body_size": 20971520,
  "geoip_fail_open": true
}
```

---

## IP whitelist

`whitelist_ip` and `ip_whitelist_file` exempt addresses from the checks that
judge a client by *where it comes from*, without switching the WAF off for
them. Inline and file-backed entries are combined.

```caddyfile
waf {
    rule_file rules.json

    # The token expands to Caddy's own private_ranges set.
    whitelist_ip private_ranges

    # Bare IPs and CIDR ranges work too, and the directive is repeatable.
    whitelist_ip 203.0.113.4 198.51.100.0/24

    # One entry per line; changes are hot-reloaded.
    ip_whitelist_file ip_whitelist.txt
}
```

An `ip_whitelist_file` uses the same entry forms as `whitelist_ip`, including
`private_ranges`. Leading and trailing whitespace is removed; blank lines and
lines beginning with `#` are ignored. If the path does not exist while parsing
a Caddyfile, an empty file is created. JSON configurations must point to an
existing readable file.

`private_ranges` expands to exactly the set Caddy uses for its own placeholder:
`192.168.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `127.0.0.1/8`, `fd00::/8`,
`::1`. Deliberately identical rather than "improved" — a WAF and the server in
front of it disagreeing about which addresses are private is how bypasses get
built.

An entry that does not parse fails startup. It is not skipped with a warning:
silently dropping an entry leaves the operator believing an address is exempt
when it is not. A malformed or unreadable hot-reload update is rejected as a
whole, retaining the last known-good in-memory whitelist.

### What the exemption covers

| Check | Exempt? |
|---|---|
| IP blacklist (including Tor exit nodes fed into it) | **yes** |
| `whitelist_countries` / `block_countries` (GeoIP) | **yes** |
| `block_asns` | **yes** |
| DNS blacklist | no — it judges the requested host, not the client |
| Rate limiting | no |
| Regex rules, all four phases | no |

This is the point of the feature rather than a limitation. The case it solves
([#137](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/137)) is a private
address being blocked by `whitelist_countries` because it has no geolocation.
The answer to that is to exempt it from geolocation — not to stop inspecting its
requests.

Previously the only workaround was `geoip_fail_open`, which lets *every*
unresolvable address through, or maintaining two site blocks with separate rule
sets.

### It matches the peer address only

The whitelist reads `r.RemoteAddr` and **never** `X-Forwarded-For`. That is the
opposite of the blacklist, which checks the peer address *and* every forwarded
hop, and the asymmetry is deliberate:

- When **blocking**, consulting extra addresses can only block more. Safe.
- When **allowing**, honouring a client-supplied header would let anyone send
  `X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.1` and exempt themselves from the blacklist, the
  country filter and the ASN filter in one move.

The peer address is the only value a client cannot forge, so it is the only one
trusted here.

> [!WARNING]
> **`private_ranges` is only safe when caddy-waf is the edge.**
>
> Because the check is on the peer address, running caddy-waf *behind* another
> proxy means the peer is that proxy — typically a loopback or private address.
> Whitelisting `private_ranges` would then exempt **every** request arriving
> through it, silently disabling the IP blacklist, the country filter and the ASN
> filter for all traffic.
>
> The WAF logs a warning at startup when `private_ranges` is whitelisted, for
> exactly this reason.
>
> **Listing specific client addresses is not a workaround.** Behind a proxy the
> peer address is *always* that proxy, so no entry naming a real client will ever
> match — the only address `whitelist_ip` can match is the proxy itself, which
> exempts all traffic through it. In that topology the directive cannot express
> "exempt this client" at all.
>
> Until [#94](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/94) adds
> `trusted_proxies`, and with it a defensible way to act on forwarded addresses,
> the options behind a proxy are: leave `whitelist_ip` unset, or place the WAF at
> the edge where the peer address is the client.

---

## Response body buffering

Phase 4 rules match against the response body, which means the WAF has to hold
the body until it has been inspected. That buffering is bounded on two axes:

1. **It only happens when it is needed.** If no Phase 4 rule is loaded, the
   response is never copied — it is forwarded to the client as the upstream
   produces it. The bundled `rules.json` contains no Phase 4 rules, so the
   default configuration does no response buffering at all.
2. **It never exceeds `max_response_body_size`** (default 10 MiB). Once a
   response outgrows the budget, the WAF writes out what it holds and streams
   the remainder directly to the client. The same release happens as soon as the
   upstream flushes, so server-sent events and chunked streaming are not stalled
   waiting for the budget to fill.

When a response is released early it cannot be blocked, because part of it is
already on the wire. The WAF logs this at `warn` level rather than silently
scoring a truncated body:

```
WARN  Response body exceeded the WAF inspection limit; Phase 4 rules were not applied  {"log_id":"…","max_response_body_size":10485760}
```

Raise `max_response_body_size` if you need Phase 4 rules to cover larger
responses, keeping in mind that the value is the per-in-flight-request memory
ceiling the WAF may occupy.

---

## Validation

`Middleware.Validate` (called by Caddy after `Provision`) enforces:

- `anomaly_threshold` ≥ 0
- `max_request_body_size` ≥ 0
- `max_response_body_size` ≥ 0
- `log_buffer` ≥ 0
- When `rate_limit.requests > 0`: `window > 0` and `cleanup_interval > 0`

Any of these failing aborts startup with a descriptive error.

---

## Reload semantics

The middleware installs `fsnotify` watchers on `rule_file`, `ip_blacklist_file`,
`dns_blacklist_file`, and `ip_whitelist_file` paths. Watchers observe the parent
directory, so both in-place writes and atomic replacements trigger a reload.

- Rule-file changes call [`ReloadRules`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/caddywaf.go).
- IP/DNS-blacklist changes call [`ReloadConfig`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/caddywaf.go).
- IP-whitelist changes call `ReloadIPWhitelist`, which combines the new file
  contents with all inline `whitelist_ip` entries and swaps the trie atomically.

A reload does **not** rebuild the rate limiter, the GeoIP database handles, the Tor schedule, or any other Caddyfile-only setting. To apply such changes, run `caddy reload` so Caddy re-runs `Provision`.

See [dynamicupdates.md](dynamicupdates.md) for the full reload matrix.

## Worked example

The repository ships a complete Caddyfile in [`Caddyfile`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/Caddyfile). A condensed excerpt:

```caddyfile
:8080 {
    route {
        waf {
            metrics_endpoint  /waf_metrics
            anomaly_threshold 20
            ip_whitelist_file ip_whitelist.txt

            rule_file rules.json

            ip_blacklist_file  ip_blacklist.txt
            dns_blacklist_file dns_blacklist.txt

            block_countries     GeoLite2-Country.mmdb RU CN KP
            whitelist_countries GeoLite2-Country.mmdb US

            custom_response 403 application/json error.json

            rate_limit {
                requests         100
                window           10s
                cleanup_interval 5m
                paths            /api/v1/.*
                match_all_paths  false
            }

            tor {
                enabled               true
                tor_ip_blacklist_file tor_blacklist.txt
                update_interval       24h
                retry_on_failure      true
                retry_interval        1h
            }

            log_severity info
            log_json
            log_path     debug.json
        }

        respond "Hello world!" 200
    }
}
```

> When both `block_countries` and `whitelist_countries` are configured with the same MMDB and the **same** ISO code, the whitelist wins because it is evaluated first in Phase 1.

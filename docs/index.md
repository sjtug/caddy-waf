    details: Regular expressions compiled by Go's RE2, so matching is linear-time with no catastrophic backtracking. Rules carry a score; a request is blocked once the total reaches the anomaly threshold.

## Install

Build a Caddy binary with the module using [`xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy):

```bash
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf
./caddy list-modules | grep waf    # http.handlers.waf
```

Or run the published container image, which needs no Go toolchain:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf:0.4.1
```

The module is also selectable on the [Caddy download page](https://caddyserver.com/download?package=github.com%2Ffabriziosalmi%2Fcaddy-waf), and `caddy add-package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf` works for a one-off install — though Caddy's maintainers have proposed moving that command out of core, so do not build a deployment around it ([#138](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/138)).

See [Installation](installation.md) for every supported path.

## Minimal configuration

```caddyfile
:8080 {
    route {
        waf {
            rule_file          rules.json
            ip_blacklist_file  ip_blacklist.txt
            ip_whitelist_file  ip_whitelist.txt
            dns_blacklist_file dns_blacklist.txt
            anomaly_threshold  20
            metrics_endpoint   /waf_metrics
        }
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
    }
}
```

## Reading order

A first-time reader is recommended to follow this sequence:

1. [Introduction](introduction.md) — what the middleware does and where it fits.
2. [Installation](installation.md) — supported build paths and prerequisites.
3. [Configuration](configuration.md) — the request lifecycle, every Caddyfile directive, every JSON-only field, blocking precedence.
4. [Rules](rules.md) — the JSON rule schema and target identifiers.
5. [Blacklists](blacklists.md) — file formats for IP and DNS blacklists.
6. [Rate limiting](ratelimit.md) — sliding-window request limiter, path matching.
7. [Download bandwidth quotas](bandwidthquota.md) — the SJTUG fork's persistent rolling response-byte quotas.
8. [Country and ASN blocking](geoblocking.md) — GeoIP / ASN behaviour.

## Bundled rule files

- [`rules.json`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/rules.json) — the default rule set wired into the supplied [`Caddyfile`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/blob/main/Caddyfile).
- [`rules/`](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/tree/main/rules) — modular rule files grouped by attack category. Each file is a JSON array of rules and can be referenced directly with one or more `rule_file` directives.

## Security

Only the latest release receives security fixes. Published advisories are listed under [Security → Advisories](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/security/advisories).

**v0.3.3 and earlier** are affected by [GHSA-gfj3-cmff-q8wh](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/security/advisories/GHSA-gfj3-cmff-q8wh), a high-severity unauthenticated denial of service. Fixed in v0.3.4.

To report a vulnerability, use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/security/advisories/new) rather than a public issue.

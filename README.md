## Overview

`caddy-waf` is an HTTP handler middleware that inspects requests and responses across four well-defined phases, applies a regular-expression rule set with anomaly scoring, enforces IP/DNS/ASN/country blacklists and whitelists, performs token-bucket-style rate limiting, and exposes a JSON metrics endpoint.

The WAF is registered under `http.handlers.waf`. Also the independent `http.handlers.bandwidth_quota` module is registered for persistent rolling response-byte quotas. Both can be configured through the Caddyfile or directly via JSON.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Regex rule engine | Go [`regexp`](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp) package (RE2, linear-time guarantee). Compiled patterns are cached per rule ID. |
| Multi-phase inspection | Phase 1 (request headers and pre-request checks), Phase 2 (request body), Phase 3 (response headers), Phase 4 (response body). |
| Anomaly scoring | Each rule contributes its `score` to a per-request total; requests are blocked when the total reaches `anomaly_threshold`. |
| Explicit actions | Rule `mode` of `block` or `log`. `block` short-circuits the request; `log` records the match and continues. |
| IP blacklist | Plain IPs and CIDR ranges (IPv4 and IPv6) stored in a prefix trie ([`go-iptrie`](https://github.com/phemmer/go-iptrie)). |
| DNS blacklist | Exact-match (case-insensitive) host lookup. |
| GeoIP country block / whitelist | MaxMind GeoLite2 Country MMDB. |
| ASN block | MaxMind GeoLite2 ASN MMDB. |
| Tor exit-node block | Periodic fetch from `https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist`. |
| Rate limiting | Per-IP, sliding-window, optional per-path matching with regex patterns. |
| Download bandwidth quotas | Persistent, multi-window successful-response byte quotas grouped by configurable IPv4/IPv6 prefixes. |
| Custom block responses | Per-status-code response with custom Content-Type, headers, and body (inline or from file). |
| Sensitive data redaction | Optional redaction of sensitive query parameters and log fields. |
| Hot reload | `fsnotify` watchers on rule files, IP blacklist, and DNS blacklist. |
| Metrics endpoint | JSON document exposed at the configured `metrics_endpoint` path. |
| Asynchronous logging | Buffered log channel with synchronous fallback when the buffer is full. |

## Engineering notes

- **Linear-time regex**: rules are compiled by Go's `regexp` (RE2). No catastrophic backtracking.
- **Wait-free counters**: per-rule hit counts use `atomic.Int64` stored in a `sync.Map`.
- **Bounded body reads**: request bodies are read through `io.LimitReader` (`max_request_body_size`, default 10 MiB) and restored with `io.MultiReader` so downstream handlers still see the full body.
- **Bounded response buffering**: the response body is only held in memory when a Phase 4 rule exists to inspect it, and never past `max_response_body_size` (default 10 MiB). Beyond that — or as soon as the upstream flushes — the WAF releases what it holds and streams the rest, so memory never scales with the response size.
- **Zero-copy body string**: the body is exposed to rule matching via `unsafe.String` to avoid an allocation per request.
- **Circuit breaker for GeoIP**: `geoip_fail_open` controls whether a GeoIP lookup failure blocks the request or allows it through.
- **Panic recovery**: `ServeHTTP` installs a deferred recovery that returns `500 Internal Server Error` on panic.

## Quick start

The fastest path to a working build:

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Pragma: no-cache" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script ensures Go and `xcaddy` are installed, clones the repository, downloads the GeoLite2 database, builds Caddy with the `caddy-waf` module, and starts the server.

A representative provisioning log:

```

INFO  WAF middleware provisioned successfully
```

## Installation

### Requirements

- Go **1.25.1** or newer ([`go.mod`](go.mod) declares `go 1.25.1`, propagated from `caddy/v2` which requires it)
- Caddy **v2.11.x** or newer (current build uses `github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2 v2.11.4`)
- [`xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy) for building Caddy with plugins

### Method 1 — Build with xcaddy (recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf
./caddy list-modules | grep waf   # expect: http.handlers.waf
```

### Method 2 — Quick script

```bash
curl -fsSL -H "Pragma: no-cache" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Method 3 — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf.git
cd caddy-waf
go mod tidy
wget https://git.io/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb           # optional, only for GeoIP
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf=./
./caddy fmt --overwrite
./caddy run
```

### Method 4 — `caddy add-package`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prefer `xcaddy` or the container image.** Caddy's maintainers have proposed
> moving `add-package`, `remove-package` and `upgrade` out of Caddy's core to
> discourage their use ([caddyserver/caddy#7010](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/7010)):
> the commands call Caddy's shared build server, and using them in CI/CD is an
> anti-pattern. Raised for this project in
> [#138](https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/issues/138) by a Caddy
> maintainer.
>
> The command works today and the module remains registered, so this section
> stays accurate. Treat it as a convenience for one-off, hand-operated installs
> — not as the way to build or deploy caddy-waf.

The module is registered in Caddy's package registry, so an existing Caddy v2.7+ binary can pull it in without a Go toolchain:

```bash
caddy add-package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf
caddy list-modules | grep waf   # expect: http.handlers.waf
```

It is also selectable on [caddyserver.com/download](https://caddyserver.com/download). See [`docs/add-package-guide.md`](docs/add-package-guide.md) for version pinning, removal, and when to prefer `xcaddy` instead.

### Method 5 — Docker

Images are published to GitHub Container Registry on every release tag, for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf:0.4.1
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf:0.4.1
```

Tags are `0.4.1`, `0.4` and `latest` — note there is **no `v` prefix**, unlike the Go module version. Pin an exact version in anything you deploy. See [`docs/docker.md`](docs/docker.md) for volumes, Compose, and hot reload.

## Minimal Caddyfile

```caddyfile
{
    auto_https off
    admin localhost:2019
}

:8080 {
    log {
        output stdout
        format console
        level INFO
    }

    route {
        waf {
            metrics_endpoint   /waf_metrics
            rule_file          rules.json
            ip_blacklist_file  ip_blacklist.txt
            dns_blacklist_file dns_blacklist.txt
        }

        @wafmetrics path /waf_metrics
        handle @wafmetrics {
            # Falls through to the WAF handler, which serves metrics as JSON.
        }

        handle {
            respond "Hello world!" 200
        }
    }
}
```

A fully annotated example is provided in [`Caddyfile`](Caddyfile) and [`caddyfile.example`](caddyfile.example).
